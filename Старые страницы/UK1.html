		<h1>Royal family</h1></br>
		The British royal family – pride of British. Royalties of a role in government don't play, but the faith in the monarch and honoring for centuries of history became an integral part of the English mentality. 
		The authorities in power represented by parliament don't cause special trust in ordinary British, unlike the king and the queen – venerators of tradition and the center of national unity.
Today royalties represent the country abroad, performing social and ceremonial functions. Importance of the royal family for British is indisputable. For people their monarchs – a moral standard and an example for imitation. 
When in the royal family there are problems or someone from them behaves improperly to the situation, the whole country takes it very much to heart — as own miss. 
Annually on the corresponding celebrations the queen makes the speech in which she addresses all nation, bringing up and setting on a right track, right for all Great Britain.</br>

<h3>Last Monday in August	Late Summer Bank Holiday </h3>	Statutory bank holiday from 1971,[12] following a trial period from 1965 to 1970.
